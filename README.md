# App created by using React, styled-components and react-router-dom.
This landing site is my first React project that was not somebody else's tutorial.

I wanted to build a React app and style it well without a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind. I chose to use styled-components because it enables me to write my own css code but with the added functionality of javascript.

I used React Router to build the app but I wanted to add smooth scrolling to the Features page. I couldn't do it by using react-scroll and the dropdown menu was a mess but after a while I found the library react-hash-link and it enabled me to implement both routing and smooth scrolling to my pages.

The signin and login pages of the app are there only as design pieces and are not functional as I haven't added user authentication. This was meant only as a front-end and design-focused project. Perhaps I will add back-end functionality in the future.
